# Why a new architecture



## Questions to answer

- What benefits does this new architecture bring me?









#### A word about filenames

Let's talk about the filename. The filename is: `i want to add a todo.php`. As you can see this is a filename that describes what we are going to do inside the file. You can name this file anyway you like and place it in nested directories if you wish as long as the file end in the `.php` extension. This is a very important feature for the business logic of our application. When we name our procedures with descriptive names that make sense for the business logic of our application, then when we look into the procedures directory we can immediately see what the application can do.

This point satisfies one of the points Robert C Martin highlights about a good architecture. A good architecture immediately shows it's intent. When we look into the procedures directory with well named filenames you can immediately see the intent of a firestark application.
